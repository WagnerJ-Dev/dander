# Engineering Decisions

## 2026-07-29 — Bootstrap credentials and deployment identity

- Terraform creates Secret Manager containers and IAM bindings, but never secret versions or
  values. Operators add values out of band so credentials cannot enter plans or remote state.
- GitHub deployment uses OIDC Workload Identity Federation constrained to one repository and exact
  ref. The federated principal can impersonate only a dedicated deployer; that deployer writes only
  Dander's Artifact Registry repository and can act as only Dander's runtime accounts.
- Hosted runtime plans require an immutable image digest and billing account. Planning remains the
  CLI default, and applying still uses the exact saved plan after interactive confirmation.

## 2026-07-29 — Simulation-first integrated cost guard

- The bootstrap can package the tested handler and provision its project budget, Pub/Sub topic,
  least-privilege identity, and Gen 2 function, but the entire module remains opt-in.
- Simulation is the default. Live billing detachment requires `--live-cost-guard`, a reviewed saved
  plan, and confirmation that explicitly names the destructive behavior.
- Budget notifications are delayed and not a spending cap. Function deployment uses billable GCP
  services, so its plan is never represented as guaranteeing a zero-dollar outcome.
