# Engineering Decisions

## 2026-07-29 — Bootstrap credentials and deployment identity

- Terraform creates Secret Manager containers and IAM bindings, but never secret versions or
  values. Operators add values out of band so credentials cannot enter plans or remote state.
- GitHub deployment uses OIDC Workload Identity Federation constrained to one repository and exact
  ref. The federated principal can impersonate only a dedicated deployer; that deployer writes only
  Dander's Artifact Registry repository and can act as only Dander's runtime accounts.
- Hosted runtime plans require an immutable image digest and billing account. Planning remains the
  CLI default, and applying still uses the exact saved plan after interactive confirmation.

## 2026-07-29 — Simulation-first integrated cost guard

- The bootstrap can package the tested handler and provision its project budget, Pub/Sub topic,
  least-privilege identity, and Gen 2 function, but the entire module remains opt-in.
- Simulation is the default. Live billing detachment requires `--live-cost-guard`, a reviewed saved
  plan, and confirmation that explicitly names the destructive behavior.
- Budget notifications are delayed and not a spending cap. Function deployment uses billable GCP
  services, so its plan is never represented as guaranteeing a zero-dollar outcome.

## 2026-07-29 — BigQuery history and append semantics

- Incremental batches use cursor validation plus SCD1 key merge; extraction and watermark state
  own the lower bound, while the writer owns rerun idempotence.
- Snapshots never update/delete history. They use a configured date/timestamp partition and
  suppress exact rows both across reruns and within one incoming batch.
- SCD2 computes changed rows once, then closes and inserts versions in one transaction. System
  columns are reserved and nested values compare through canonical BigQuery JSON rendering.

## 2026-07-29 — Incremental transform boundary

- Incremental model metadata explicitly names its unique key and cursor; these are never inferred
  from generic tests or column naming conventions.
- Builds include rows at or above the existing maximum cursor, deduplicate each key by latest
  cursor, and `MERGE`. Re-reading the boundary handles tied timestamps without losing rows and is
  safe because the merge is idempotent; canonical JSON is the deterministic final tie-breaker.

## 2026-07-29 — Concrete enterprise ingestion proof

- Workday RaaS is the first hand-rolled `EnterpriseSource`: connector config selects it explicitly,
  while downstream runtime/writer/state code continues depending only on `Source`.
- Response envelopes, page progression, cursor params, bounded retry/backoff, and scalar casts are
  owned by this path. Transport and sleeping are injected so tests use no tenant or credential.
- Schema discovery returns declarations only. Cast failures expose field/type contract names but
  never rejected row values.
